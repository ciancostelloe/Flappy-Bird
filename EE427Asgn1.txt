; for Single Cycle Computer (SCC), Fearghal Morgan
;
; =================================
; Load register R3 with value F104h
; =================================
;
; Objective: Write a SCC assembly program to perform the above.
; Refer to SCC diagram and SCC instruction set.
; Use viciLab SCC project to compile, execute and test the assembly program on remote (or local FPGA hardware)
; Run the program and step (viciLab down arrow) to observe and verify time interrupt execution.
; Use a minimum number of instructions, though as many different instruction types as possible.
; Highest marks will be awarded to the smallest program and the most different instruction types.
; Submit 
;   Screen capture of IDE (program, with LED widgets)  
;
; Use a minimum number of instructions, though as many different instruction types as possible.
; Highest marks will be awarded to the smallest program and the most different instruction types.
; Submit 
;   Screen capture of IDE (program and 7-segment display widgets)
;   No of instructions: ________
;   No of different instruction types: ___________
;
; Assume: 
; clk freq=25MHz, period=40ns 
; Max program memory size is 128 instructions 
; Any instructions not included here will be NOP (FE00h) instructions in the program memory;
;         Main program   :0h-5bh  / 0-91d   / 0000000-10101011b  
;         ISRs: 12 instructions max per ISR, including RETI instruction
;            ISR0(inPort(0)):5ch-67h / 92d-103d / 01011100-01100111b  
;            ISR1(inPort(1)):68h-73h / 104d-115d / 01101000-01110011b  
;            ISR2 (timer)   :74h-7fh / 116d-127d / 01110100-01111111b 
;         constant ISRAddArray : ISRArray := (X"74", X"68", X"5c"); -- VHDL ISR 2, 1, 0 pointers 
; Data and stack memory size is 32. Default Stack Pointer (SP) is address 008  
; Always end the main program with the END 'end program' instruction to prevent inadvertent instruction execution.
